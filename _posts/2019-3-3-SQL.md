### 1. CrossTab view in MySQL

Tables
EMP - EMPId(Primary Key), EmpSal, DeptId(FK), EmpName

DEPT - DeptId(Primary key), DeptLoc (has data like US, India, China....list of countries), DeptName

#### Q1: CrossTab DeptName, DeptLoc, with cell-value as $ as sum salary

| DeptName    | US    |  Non_US  |
| --------   | -----:   | :----: |
| Advertising |$     |$    |
| Sales        | $     |   $   |
| Marketing        | $     |   $    |

$ = sum salary in each combination of DeptLoc and DeptName

#### Solution:

```sql
SELECT D.Deptname,
SUM(CASE WHEN D.Deptloc = 'US' THEN E.EmpSal ELSE 0 END) US,
SUM(CASE WHEN D.Deptloc != 'US' THEN E.EmpSal ELSE 0 END) Non_US
FROM Dept D right join Emp E
on E.DepId = D.DeptId
GROUP BY D.Deptname;
```

### 2. Window Function in MySQL

#### Q2: DeptName and 2nd highest salary within Dept

```sql
SELECT T.Deptname, T.EmpSal
FROM
(SELECT P.Deptname, P.EmpSal, DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY P.Deptname ORDER BY P.EmpSal DESC) AS ran
FROM
(SELECT * FROM
Dept D RIGHT JOIN Emp E
ON E.DepId = D.DeptId) P) T
WHERE T.ran = 2;
```


### 3. Rank question

#### 3.1 No group

#### Q3: Second Hightest Salary

```sql
SELECT max(e2.Salary) as SecondHighestSalary
FROM
Employee as e1, Employee as e2
WHERE e1.Salary > e2.Salary;
```

##### or (window function)

```SQL
SELECT distinct(P.Salary) as SecondHighestSalary
FROM
(SELECT Salary, dense_rank() OVER (ORDER BY Salary DESC) as ran
FROM
Employee) P
WHERE P.ran = 2;
```

#### Q4: Rank Scores:

Ties are assigned the same rank and the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. (DENSE_RANK())

![image](https://github.com/manpanmanpan/manpanmanpan.github.io/blob/master/img/1552513051(1).jpg?raw=true)

```sql
SELECT s2.score,
(SELECT count(distinct s1.score)
FROM
scores as s1 WHERE s1.score >= s2.score) as rank1
FROM scores as s2
ORDER BY rank1;
```
Ties are assigned the same rank and the next ranking skipped.(RANK())

```sql
SELECT s2.score,
(SELECT (count(s1.score)+1)
FROM scores as s1 WHERE s1.score > s2.score) as rank1
FROM scores as s2
ORDER BY rank1;
```

#### 3.2 By group

#### Q5: Department Hightest Salary

```SQL
SELECT d.name as department, e.name as employee, e.salary
FROM
Department as d inner join Employee as e
ON e.DepartmentId = d.Id
WHERE e.Salary=
(SELECT max(Salary) FROM Employee WHERE DepartmentId = d.Id);
```

##### or

```SQL
SELECT d.name as department, e.name as employee, e.salary
FROM
Department as d inner join Employee as e
ON e.DepartmentId = d.Id
WHERE (e.Salary, e.DepartmentId) in
(SELECT max(Salary),DepartmentId FROM Employee GROUP BY DepartmentId);
```

#### Q6: Department Top Three Salaries

```SQL
SELECT p.Department, p.Employee, p.salary
FROM
(SELECT d.Name as Department, e2.Name as Employee, e2.Salary as Salary,
(SELECT count(distinct e1.Salary) FROM Employee as e1
WHERE e1.Salary >= e2.Salary AND e1.DepartmentId = d.Id) as rak
FROM
Employee as e2 INNER JOIN Department as d
ON d.Id = e2.DepartmentId
ORDER BY rak) p
WHERE p.rak <= 3
ORDER BY p.Department,p.rak;
```

##### or (window function)

```sql
SELECT T.Department, T.Employee, T.Salary
FROM
(SELECT p.Department, p.Employee, p.Salary, DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY p.DepartmentId ORDER BY p.Salary DESC) as rank1
FROM
(SELECT d.Name as Department, e.Name as Employee, e.Salary as Salary, e.DepartmentId as DepartmentId
FROM
Employee as e INNER JOIN Department as d
ON e.DepartmentId = d.Id) p) T
WHERE T.rank1 <= 3;
```
