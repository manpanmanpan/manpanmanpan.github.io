## SAS Notes

## 1. Reading External 
## 1.1 Reading Raw Data

``` SAS
* Create a SAS data set named contest;
* Read the file Pumpkin.dat using formatted input;
DATA contest;
   INFILE 'c:\MyRawData\Pumpkin.dat';
   INPUT Name $16. Age 3. +1 Type $1. +1 Date MMDDYY10.
         (Score1 Score2 Score3 Score4 Score5) (4.1);
RUN;
* Print the data set to make sure the file was read correctly;
PROC PRINT DATA = contest;
   TITLE 'Pumpkin Carving Contest';
RUN;
```
- The variable Name has an informat of $16., meaning that it is a character variable 16 columns wide.
- Variable Age has an informat of three, is numeric, three columns wide, and has no decimal places. The +1 skips over one column. 
- Variable Type is character, and it is one column wide. 
- Variable Date has an informat MMDDYY10. and reads dates in the form 10-31-2003 or 10/31/2003, each 10 columns wide. 
- The remaining variables, Score1 through Score5, all require the same informat, 4.1. By putting the variables and the informat in separate sets of parentheses, you only have to list the informat once.

## 1.2 Reading Multiple Lines of Raw Data per Observation

**Raw Data**
![image](https://github.com/manpanmanpan/manpanmanpan.github.io/blob/master/img/1553391665(1).jpg?raw=true)

```SAS
* Create a SAS data set named highlow;
* Read the data file using line pointers;
DATA highlow;
   INFILE 'c:\MyRawData\Temperature.dat';
   INPUT City $ State $ 
         / NormalHigh NormalLow
         #3 RecordHigh RecordLow;
RUN;
```
The input statement reads the values of City and State from the first line. Then the slash tells SAS to move to column 1 of the next line before reading NormalHigh and NormalLow. #3 tells SAS to move to column1 of the third line before reading RecordHigh and RecordLow. **We also can replace the slash with #2 or replace #3 with a slash**.

## 1.3 Controlling Input with Options in the INFILE Statement

- **FIRSTOBS**: The FIRSTOBS= option tells SAS at what line to begin reading data

- **OBS**: The OBS= option can be used anytime you want to read only a part of your data file. It tells SAS to stop reading when it gets to that line in the raw data file.

- **MISSOVER, TURNOVER** : Both will assign missing values to variables if the data line ends before the variable’s field starts. But when the data line ends in the middle of a variable field, TRUNCOVER will take as much as is there, whereas MISSOVER will assign the variable a missing value.

- **DLM, DSD**: useful for Delimiter files

## 1.4 Reading Files with the IMPORT Procedure

### CSV
```SAS
PROC IMPORT DATAFILE ='c:\MyRawData\Bands2.csv' OUT = music REPLACE;
RUN;
PROC PRINT DATA = music;    
   TITLE 'Customers at Each Gig'; RUN;
```
### XLS
```SAS
PROC IMPORT DATAFILE = 'c:\MyExcelFiles\OnionRing.xls' DBMS=XLS OUT = sales;
RUN;
PROC PRINT DATA = sales;
   TITLE 'SAS Data Set Read From Excel File'; RUN;
```

## 1.5 Temporary versus Permanent SAS Data Sets

** Creating a permanent SAS data set**

```SAS
LIBNAME plants 'c:\MySASLib';
DATA plants.magnolia;
   INFILE 'c:\MyRawData\Mag.dat';
   INPUT ScientificName $ 1-14 CommonName $ 16-32 MaximumHeight
      AgeBloom Type $ Color $;
RUN;
```

**Reading a permanent SAS data set**

```SAS
LIBNAME example 'c:\MySASLib';
PROC PRINT DATA = example.magnolia;
   TITLE 'Magnolias';
RUN;
```

**Temporary SAS data sets** (WORK.)

The following program creates and then prints a temporary SAS data set named DISTANCE:

```SAS
DATA distance;
Miles = 26.22;
Kilometers = 1.61 * Miles;
PROC PRINT DATA = distance;
RUN;
```

## 1.6 Listing the Contents of a SAS Data Set

```SAS
DATA funnies;
INPUT Id Name $ Height Weight DoB MMDDYY8.;
LABEL Id = ’Identification no.’
Height = ’Height in inches’
Weight = ’Weight in pounds’
DoB = ’Date of birth’;
INFORMAT DoB MMDDYY8.;
FORMAT DoB WORDDATE18.;
DATALINES;
53 Susie 42 41 07-11-81
54 Charlie 46 55 10-26-54
55 Calvin 40 35 01-10-81
56 Lucy 46 52 01-13-55
;


* Use PROC CONTENTS to describe data set funnies;
PROC CONTENTS DATA = funnies;
RUN;
```
