$$\frac{x^3}{x^2}$$


Imagine we did a study comparing a placebo group to a group that received a new blood pressure medication and the mean blood pressure in the treatment group was 20 mm Hg lower than the placebo group. Assuming the null hypothesis is correct the p-value is the probability that if we repeated the study the observed difference between the group averages would be at least 20.
